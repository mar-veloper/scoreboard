# Among Us Scoreboard

## Why I created this project?

*For technical reason*:
I created this project to learn about JAMstack and how Netlify Function works with FaunaDB.

*For client reason*: 
Me and my friend would like to see our live scores on the game we like to play called _Among Us_.

## This project is being built using JAMstack: 
Frontend: _React_
Serverless: _Netlify Function_
Database: _FaunaDB_
